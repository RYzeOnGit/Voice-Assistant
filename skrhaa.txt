Yo
Big Shaq, the one and only
Man’s not hot, never hot
Skrrat (GottiOnEm), skidi-kat-kat
Boom

Two plus two is four
Minus one, that’s three, quick maths
Every day, man’s on the block
Smoke trees (Ah)
See your girl in the park
That girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack
You man were ducking (You man ducked)
Hold tight, Asznee (My brudda)
He’s got the pumpy (Big ting)
Hold tight, my man (My guy)
He’s got the frisbee (Few)
